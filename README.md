# GEMINI - Navigation System


GEMINI is a spacecraft guidance system built from the ground up. The unit is box-vessel containing gyroscopes consisting of papier-mâché encasings and tetrahedral photodiode systems via Arduino Bluetooth. GEMINI wirelessly displays a mission control using Java Swing, updating pitch, yaw, and roll in real-time.
